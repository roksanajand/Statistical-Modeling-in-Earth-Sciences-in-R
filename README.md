## Exercise 1
### Statistical Analysis and Data Processing in R

This repository showcases various statistical and data analysis exercises in R, including:

- **Vector Operations:** Creating vectors, performing operations like summation.
- **Descriptive Statistics and Visualization:** Analyzing North American river lengths, calculating key statistics (e.g., mean, median, variance), and visualizing the data with histograms.
- **Gravity Data Analysis:** Importing, renaming, and visualizing measured and modeled gravity data using `ggplot2`.
- **Custom Functions:** Creating a function to compute powers (`x^y`) with demonstrations.
- **Soil Acidity Analysis:** Processing soil pH data from Canada, calculating statistical measures (range, mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range), and visualizing the distribution with boxplots highlighting outliers.

## Exercise 2
### Earthquake Data Analysis and Linear Regression

This section of the project focuses on analyzing earthquake data in the Fiji region using the built-in `quakes` dataset. Key tasks include:

- **Visualization of Earthquake Epicenters:** Created a map of earthquake epicenters using latitude and longitude data.
- **Relationship Between Magnitude and Station Count:** Explored the relationship between earthquake magnitude and the number of recording stations using scatter plots, with added random noise for better data visualization.
- **Statistical Analysis of Magnitudes:** Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.) and visualized magnitudes using a boxplot. Computed covariance and correlation between magnitude and station counts.
- **Linear Regression Analysis:** Built a linear regression model to study the relationship between earthquake magnitude and station count, visualized with a regression line.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the linear regression model using key metrics such as Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), Residual Standard Error (RSE), Proximity Coefficient (φ²), and Coefficient of Determination (R²).
