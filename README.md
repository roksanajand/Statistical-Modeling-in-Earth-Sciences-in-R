### Statistical Analysis and Data Processing in R

This repository showcases various statistical and data analysis exercises in R, including:

- **Vector Operations:** Creating vectors, performing operations like summation.
- **Descriptive Statistics and Visualization:** Analyzing North American river lengths, calculating key statistics (e.g., mean, median, variance), and visualizing the data with histograms.
- **Gravity Data Analysis:** Importing, renaming, and visualizing measured and modeled gravity data using `ggplot2`.
- **Custom Functions:** Creating a function to compute powers (`x^y`) with demonstrations.
- **Soil Acidity Analysis:** Processing soil pH data from Canada, calculating statistical measures (range, mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range), and visualizing the distribution with boxplots highlighting outliers.
